# shellcheck shell=sh
# shellcheck disable=SC1090

# This profile is mainly just for storing environment variables. It is meant to be sourced by
# multiple shells (bash, zsh, and fish using fenv) so the syntax should be POSIX compliant.
#
# So why not just store this in config.fish?
# - Sometimes I mess around with other shells, and having these environment variables available in
#   them is useful. Fish isn't POSIX compliant, so storing the environment variables separately
#   makes it possible for other shells to load them.
#
# - On macOS and Linux I've had issues where apps that are launched from some form of dock or
#   launcher (e.g. spotlight) use the system's default login shell (zsh, bash) instead of fish even
#   if fish is configured as the login shell. If my environment is set up in config.fish, but these
#   apps are trying to use the other shells, they end up with the wrong environment. Using a
#   separate profile means that I can set up other shells to also load this environment to ensure
#   apps that encounter this issue still have the correct environment.

# $0 is not the path of the profile, so it can't be used to find the path to the dotfiles repository
# For now, I'm going to assume the dotfiles is in one specific location
