This directory stores package lists that are used when running the `install`
script. Some packages have different names on macOS and Linux, so I use
separate lists to list out each package for each operating system.

The lists can have blank lines, and lines starting with `#` are viewed as
comments. Inline comments are not allowed, the first character has to be a `#`.
